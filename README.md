# RBXL-to-Lune
Roblox - Lune / Rojo compatible, easily transfer RBLX to a VScode format that is easily interperated idek 


just create a source file in the root directory with a filetree like ./src and then inside of it have ./client ./server ./shared, make sure to have rokit installed and lune installed, then put the RBXL file into the root directory and run the script using "lune run extract_scripts.luau" and it'll work, this took me hours of banging my head on my desk to make so like i hope it helps somebody.


                     
oh and uh remember to change the name from game.rbxl to whatever u want it to be, or keep it, just make sure u name ur RBXL file to game.


I made this cuz my studio kept crashing when trying to export an XML file of my game btw.


and then if u have rojo installed u can just use "rojo build -o "whateverurgamenameisitdoesnthavetobethenameofthefile.rbxl""
